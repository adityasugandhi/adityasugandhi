# Hey, I'm Aditya Sugandhi

I build things that ship. Software engineer with 5+ years turning messy problems into production systems — from distributed data pipelines to AI agents that actually work.

### What I'm building right now

- **AI-powered resume platform** — agentic AI with RAG pipelines, vector search, and LLM orchestration. Ships real PDFs, not demos.
- **Enterprise Slack bot** — deployed an AI agent that lives in Slack, answers questions, and automates workflows 24/7.
- **Building automation platform** — 37 APIs, 35K+ devices, 172 networks. React/TypeScript frontend, Python backend, real-time WebSocket streaming.

### Stack I reach for

```
Python · TypeScript · Java · Go · React · Next.js
Kafka · Spark · Kubernetes · Docker · AWS
LLMs · RAG · Vector DBs · AI Agents
PostgreSQL · Redis · Cassandra · Grafana
```

### How I think about software

I don't build in a vacuum. Best code I've written came from sitting next to the people who use it — facility managers, researchers, operators — and iterating until it actually solves their problem. Ship fast, measure impact, repeat.

### Some numbers

- **85%** reduction in manual processes across 172+ networks
- **40%** faster debugging with LLM-powered analysis tools
- **500K+** events/day processed through event-driven microservices
- **99.5%** availability on production systems
